# EmpAnalysis Deployment Summary

## ✅ What We've Created

1. **Fresh Project Structure**
   - ✅ `EmpAnalysis.Api` - Backend Web API
   - ✅ `EmpAnalysis.Web` - Blazor Frontend 
   - ✅ `EmpAnalysis.Agent` - Windows monitoring client
   - ✅ `EmpAnalysis.Shared` - Shared models and utilities

2. **IIS Hosting Configuration**
   - ✅ `web.config` configured for IIS hosting
   - ✅ Security headers and request filtering
   - ✅ In-process hosting for better performance

3. **Automated Setup Scripts**
   - ✅ `setup-iis.ps1` - Installs IIS and .NET Hosting Bundle
   - ✅ `deploy-to-iis.ps1` - Builds and deploys to IIS
   - ✅ `setup-letsencrypt.ps1` - Configures SSL with Let's Encrypt

4. **Production Configuration**
   - ✅ Connection string configured for `EmpAnalysis` database
   - ✅ Domain configured for `lb-tech.co.uk`
   - ✅ Security settings and JWT authentication
   - ✅ Monitoring settings configured

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Environment
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
.\setup-iis.ps1
```

### Step 2: Deploy Application  
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
.\deploy-to-iis.ps1
```

### Step 3: Configure SSL (After DNS Setup)
```powershell
# Run as Administrator  
.\setup-letsencrypt.ps1
```

## 🌐 Requirements for Live Deployment

### DNS Configuration
Set these DNS records for `lb-tech.co.uk`:
```
A    lb-tech.co.uk    [YOUR_SERVER_IP]
A    www              [YOUR_SERVER_IP]
```

### Firewall Rules
Ensure these ports are open:
- **Port 80** (HTTP) - Required for Let's Encrypt validation
- **Port 443** (HTTPS) - Required for SSL traffic

### Server Requirements
- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
- Administrator privileges
- Internet connection for Let's Encrypt
- SQL Server running

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Local Testing
- [ ] Application builds successfully (`dotnet build`)
- [ ] IIS is installed and running
- [ ] Application pool starts without errors
- [ ] Website responds on http://lb-tech.co.uk (local)

### Production Testing  
- [ ] DNS points to your server
- [ ] Port 80/443 are accessible from internet
- [ ] SSL certificate installs successfully
- [ ] HTTPS redirect works
- [ ] Application loads securely

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Key Files Modified:
- `EmpAnalysis.Api/appsettings.json` - Database and domain settings
- `EmpAnalysis.Web/web.config` - IIS hosting configuration

### Database:
- Connection string points to `EmpAnalysis` database
- Uses same SQL Server instance as before

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Run all scripts as Administrator** - Required for IIS operations
2. **Configure DNS first** - Before running Let's Encrypt setup
3. **Test locally** - Before attempting SSL certificate
4. **Check logs** - If any step fails, check Windows Event Viewer

## 📞 Next Steps After Deployment

1. Access your application at `https://lb-tech.co.uk`
2. Set up database migrations if needed
3. Configure user accounts and permissions
4. Deploy monitoring agents to client machines
5. Set up automated backups
